  <h1>Biconnected Components</h1>
  <p>Two vertices are in a biconnected component if and only if they are reachable to each other after removing any vertex. For an edge biconnected component, removing any edge doesn't affect the connectivity. </p>
 </header>
 <main>
  <p>
   Biconnected components can be found offline using Tarjan's algorithm in $\mathcal O(N+M)$.
   For now, we will talk about how to maintain edge biconnected components online in $\mathcal O(N\log N+M)$. Although the following presented algorithm has an extra $\log$ factor, it performs quite fast in practice.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
   First, each vertex will belong in exactly one biconnected component. Then, compress each vertex into its component. Now, there must not exist a cycle; otherwise, the biconnected components contained in the cycle would be merged into a single biconnected component.
  </p>
  <p>
   Let's say we add an edge $(u, v)$. We have $3$ cases:
   <ol>
    <li>
     Vertices $u$ and $v$ are not connected.
    </li>
    <li>
     Vertices $u$ and $v$ are in the same biconnected comonent.
    </li>
    <li>
     Connecting vertices $u$ and $v$ creates a cycle on the compressed tree.
    </li>
   </ol>
   For case 1, $(u, v)$ is a bridge, so the components (not biconnected components) $u$ and $v$ will be merged into one. This can be done with a classic Disjoint Union Set.
   For case 2, adding the edge does not change the biconnectivity of the graph, so nothing needs to be done.
  </p>
  <p>
   Case 3 is a bit trickier. As mentioned before, all biconnected components on cycles should be compressed into a single one. Therefore, all the biconnected components on the path from $u$ to $v$ on the tree should be merged into one. To find these components, root the tree at a random biconnected components and maintain the parents of the others. Now, we can brute-forcely walk up the tree from both $u$ and $v$ until we reach a common node. Afterwards, you can find the least common ancestor of $u$ and $v$ so the components on the cycle are found. In total, at most $N-1$ biconnected components are merged, so the overall time complexity amortizes to $\mathcal O(N)$.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lastly, we have to deal with case 1, since we're maintaining the parents of each biconnected component. Since the root of the trees can be arbitrary chosen, we can make a DFS on the smaller tree, updating the parents of each vertex. Since we're spending time linear to the smaller component, so the time complexity of this portion amortizes to $\mathcal O(N\log N)$.
